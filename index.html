                    Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album
                    Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by
                    the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut album of the
                    decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales. Linkin Park's following
                    studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), continued the band's success.

                    Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album,
                    Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in
                    2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label,
                    Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as
                    Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).

                        child.
